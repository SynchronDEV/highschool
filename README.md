Two projects I did during my first semester at KTH


* Inventory stock emulator, allowing for addition and modification of items including their quantity and product number. 
Made for an assignment during my time at KTH. The code passed the assignment.

* "Measurement tool", did a bunch of calculations such as median value and average value based on int contents of an array
